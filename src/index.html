    <h3>Story</h3>
    Purin is the boss of PurinWare Inc, you are a new employee tasked with helping Purin going through her day.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    This game is inspired from the WarioWare Inc game, but with Purin instead of Wario.<br>
    When Purin played WarioWare inc on stream, I thought she may like a game like this with her in it.<br>
    It use a mix of redraw version of the original game asset and completely new asset.<br>
    The code is completely written from zero.<br>
